    <p id="dayStory">Hmmm... where do i start, I am actually writing this on the 17th of october because i had issues setting up the website on github. <br><br>
    But hey, the journey has just begun right? <br><br>
    So on this day, i sterted building this journal using just html and css. Prior to the project, I had taken up a web development course on udemy by Angela Yu. and I am using every knowledge I learn on this website. All while journalling my whole process and day. <br><br>

    Got the idea to build a blog layout while searching for html projects for beginners and so i thought to myself, rather than a blog, why dont I build a journalling site. at least for myself, while I learn and build more knowledge through Angela's course. <br><br>

    I started with the html boiler plate template by typing in "!" and hitting enter. Which automatically lays out a template begining with the DOCTYPE declaration followed by the head and body elements. <br><br>

    Then I named the title as you can see on the tab on every page in this website. i created and linked a css file to style the home page. Then i finally used the list elements to create a link for each day i write a journal. <br><br>

    The process was basic and fast. But this was all i did today. <br><br>

    Generally I had a great day at work, and also learning.
